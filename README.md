# rubiks-cube-solver
this is a matlab code that solves rubik's cube. I it is modulated in many functions to be used in any other project.It solves the code using the beginners' algorithm,though the modular functions enables you to handle the "visual cube" and make your own algorithm .

you will find some functions like "shrink.m" which was a way to optimze the algorithm by reducing redundent moves and replacing long patterns with shorter ones.
